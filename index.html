      <h2>Welcome to Computer Science at Cornell Universiy</h2>
      <h6>With Greeting from the Chair,  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/">Éva Tardos</a> </h6>
      <p>Cornell's Computer Science department is one of the first of its kind, founded in 1965. Today, more than a half-century later, CS is part of <a href="http://cis.cornell.edu/">Computing and Information</a> (CIS), which was established as an academic unit in 1999 and celebrated its <a href="https://www.cornellcis20.com/">twentieth anniversary</a> in October 2019. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The two-campus department—in Ithaca and New York City—has a full-time faculty of 62 members: of these, 49 are in residence at the Ithaca campus while 13 sit at the Cornell Tech campus in New York City. There are about 1,000 undergraduate CS majors (of which over 400 are women), approximately 200 resident Ph.D. students and 140 masters students. Over 300 undergraduate students graduate each year. 39.29% of majors are female; 12.78% are URM. In the incoming Ph.D. class, 45% are female and 5% are URM. </p>
      <br>
      <p> <a href="http://cornell.edu/">Cornell university</a> is located in <a href="https://www.cityofithaca.org/">Ithaca</a>,  a city of about 30,000 people in the heart of the Finger Lakes region of Central New York. Both Cornell and Ithaca offer a wide range of cultural activities, sports events, and outdoor activities with the pleasures of both city and country close at hand. What they say is true: Ithaca is gorges. Click <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/visit/">this link for information about visiting</a> Cornell.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When I'm not teaching, hosting Cornell CS events, or traveling to academic conferences, you can usually find me in my office in Gates Hall. Please do come by for a visit. —Kavita</p>
